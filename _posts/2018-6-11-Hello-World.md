Hi everyone!  I am a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in the [Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization program](http://aco.math.cmu.edu/), where I am advised by [Benjamin Moseley](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/moseleyb/).  My primary research interest is algorithms, particularly the design and analysis of algorithms in the "Massively Parallel Model of Computation" as well as online and approximation algorithms.

Look forward to posts about mathematics, computer science, and operations research.  I will likeley start off with a brief series of posts introducing the so called "Massively Parallel Model of Computation".
