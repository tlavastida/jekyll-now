Hi everyone!  I am a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in the [Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization program](http://aco.math.cmu.edu/), where I am advised by [Benjamin Moseley](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/moseleyb/).  My primary research interest is online and approximation algorithms.

Look forward to posts about computer science, operations research, and (possibly) cooking.
